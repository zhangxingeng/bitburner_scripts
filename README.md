# Bitburner Scripts
- My scripts for the game Bitburner, showcasing my coding style and problem-solving skills.
- Entirely written by me from scratch. (except the `NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts` file which is type definitions for the game's API)
- The scripts are written in TypeScript.
- The purpose of the scripts is to automate a hacking (simulation) system to automatically extract money from servers.
