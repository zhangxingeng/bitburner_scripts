# Bitburner Scripts: Cybernetic Symphony in TypeScript

Welcome to the neon-lit corridors of my Bitburner scripts repository—a digital testament to my TypeScript prowess, designed to resonate with the rhythm of the cybernetic underground. In this realm where code intertwines with consciousness, I've crafted a suite of scripts that not only augment your Bitburner experience but also showcase the artistry of TypeScript in the sprawling metropolis of the Net.

## Repository Overview

Within this repository lies a collection of meticulously engineered scripts, each a cog in the grand machine of Bitburner automation. From orchestrating seamless server infiltrations to optimizing hacknet operations, these scripts are the embodiment of efficiency and elegance in TypeScript.

## Features

- **Augmentation Automation**: Scripts that navigate the labyrinth of augmentations, ensuring your ascent in the digital hierarchy is both swift and strategic.
- **Dynamic Deployment**: Real-time adaptation to the ever-evolving landscape of servers, deploying exploits with precision and grace.
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent management of hacknet nodes and other assets, maximizing your digital dominion's growth and sustainability.

## Getting Started

To synchronize these scripts with your Bitburner environment and embark on your journey through the data streams, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Jack into the mainframe and pull the latest code from the cyber repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zhangxingeng/bitburner_scripts.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Equip your toolkit with the necessary modules to interface with the digital realm.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure the Environment**: Align the scripts with your personal setup by adjusting the configuration files to match your cybernetic signature.
4. **Deploy to Bitburner**: Upload the scripts into the Bitburner universe, integrating them into your cybernetic arsenal.
